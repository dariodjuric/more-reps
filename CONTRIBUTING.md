# Contributing

First of all, thank you for considering contributing to More Reps!  Feel welcome and read the following sections in order to know how to ask questions and how to work on something.

## How to file a bug report

When filing a GitHub issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

1. What browser are you using?
2. What did you do?
3. What did you expect to see?
4. What did you see instead?

## How to suggest a new feature

If you'd like to suggest a new feature, feel free to open a GitHub issue for it, and we can discuss it there. Afterwards, we can open a new issue for the implementation.

## How to set up your environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill out the empty fields.

Then, run `npm install` and run `npm run dev` to start the app at http://localhost:3000.
