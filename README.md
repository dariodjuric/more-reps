# More Reps

More Reps is an open-source fitness tracker, currently running at [morereps.app](https://morereps.app).

It was created for two reasons:
1. To provide a really simple, free, fitness tracker for anyone looking for one.
2. To show what can be done with frameworks such as [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Next Auth](https://next-auth.js.org/), [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/), and [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io).

You are welcome to use the app, inspect its source code, or even contribute to it.
